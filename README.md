# About
Maâ€™arefah Application is inspired by a real initiative in Collge of Computer Science & Information Technology  at Imam Abdulrahman  bin Faisal University in Saudi Arabia. The application will help to digitize the initiative and keep the initiative going during these times of COVID-19 spread. The application will enable peer-to-peer teaching where volunteering students from a higher academic level will be able to conduct online sessions through zoom meetings teaching the hard concepts in college courses and enable learning students to register and attend those sessions then rate the tutor.

## Running Admin Pages on Flutter Web
- To test this, add a web app in the Firebase project settings, and export the generated ```firebaseConfig``` variable in your project
```export var firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "<your-api-key>",
    authDomain: "<your-auth-domain>",
    databaseURL: "<your-database-url>",
    projectId: "<your-project-id>",
    storageBucket: "<your-storage-bucket>",
    messagingSenderId: "<your-messaging-sender-id>",
    appId: "<your-app-id>",
    measurementId: "<your-measurement-id>"
};
```
This is then imported in the index.html file:
```<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/8.3.1/firebase-app.js"></script>
<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/7.20.0/firebase-firestore.js"></script>

<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/7.20.0/firebase-analytics.js"></script>
```
